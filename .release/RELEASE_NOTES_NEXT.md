# Vaulthalla for AI agents

## Let Claude Code or Codex operate Vaulthalla

`vh mcp` is a Model Context Protocol server built into the `vh` CLI, and `vh skill install --agent claude|codex`
sets an agent up in one step: it writes a `vaulthalla` skill (safety guidance plus a reference of every command
agents may run) and registers the server with the agent's CLI, or prints the command when that CLI isn't installed.

- **The agent acts as you.** Every tool call is an ordinary, non-interactive `vh` command, so your Vaulthalla roles
  and permissions decide what works.
- **Destructive commands need your OK every time.** Deleting, revoking, purging, rotating keys or restoring over files
  is refused by the MCP server until the agent passes an explicit destructive acknowledgement, which it is told to
  give only after you approve, even where the command itself wouldn't ask without a terminal.
- **Confirmations stay with you.** A command that would ask you to confirm (deleting a user or vault, an encryption
  waiver, a restore over files, a bucket cleanup) refuses first; the agent has to show you the message and may only
  pass the confirmation after you approve. The server never adds `--yes` or `--accept-*` itself.
- **Keys and secrets stay out of reach.** Vault key export, secret export, `secrets update`, `setup`, `teardown`
  and `fs get|put` are never available to agents.
- Tools: `vh_help` to browse commands, `vh_read` for read-only commands, `vh_run` for the rest, and typed tools such
  as `users_create`, `vaults_delete` and `recovery_restore`. Each is marked read, write or destructive, so clients
  can run read-only tools freely and ask before destructive ones.

Calls run side by side, can be cancelled by the agent, and are abandoned after 10 minutes without a result
(`VAULTHALLA_MCP_TIMEOUT`).

See [AI Agents And MCP](https://vaulthalla.io/docs/admin/mcp-and-agents).

## Every command now says what it does

Each `vh` command declares whether it reads, writes or is destructive. The machine-readable contract
(`vh_usage --json`) carries it as `effect`.
